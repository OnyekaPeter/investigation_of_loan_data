#  Getting to know the Borrower's who request for Loans from Prosper Loan Data
## by Onyeka


## Dataset

> The Loan Data from Prosper contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. After the preliminary wrangling where nan values and duplicated rows were removed the new prosper loan dataset now contained 109,537 loans (rows) with 16 variables on each loan. The the variable on each loan was reduced from 81  to 16 because, these 16 variables in the dataset are of interest to me in my data analysis exploration.

## Summary of Findings

> From the barplot of EmploymentStatus against counts, it can be observed that more people who requested for the loan are employed of which majority are self-employed. Which means they would most likely pay back the loan with interest, which would favour the lender. But for making any conclusion, from the barplot above, we can only tell that the majority of the borrowers are self employed so we need to further explore for example, the income range or the monthly income of the borrowers to know if they can afford to pay back the loan.

> From the barplot of the borrowers income range, it can be inferred that most of the borrowers that requested for the loan has an income range between \\$25,000-49,999 and \\$50,000-74,999. Knowing the borrowers income range still would not guarantee he/she would be able to pay back the loan as this would depend on the amount of the original loan taken by the borrower plus the lenders interest.

> From the histogram above, it can be observed that more borrowers requested for a loan of \\$5000. A good numbers of borrowers also requested a loan amount of about \\$15000 and \\$10000.

> From the histogram plot of counts against StatedMonthlyIncome, it can be said that majority of the borrowers of the loan earn between \\$4000-5000 dollars as their monthly income. it should be noted that this monthly income was stated by the borrowers themselves while requesting for the loan. So, it would be appropriate to verify these income stated by the borrowers.

> The pie chart of how true or false are the borrowers income requesting for loan indicates that majority of the borrowers who stated their income are telling the truth. This means the lender can trust a good number of people requesting for the loan.

> Majority of the borrowers are likely to pay about 200 to \\$250 as their MonthlyLoanPayment from the histogram of counts against.
